
# This project is on FLIM inverse modeling.
 1st part we are going to train an Autoencoder by two different dataset.
 2nd part, we will train a CNN with Autoencoder bottleneck features.
 To test the stability of the Autoencoder we are going to train the DL model with two different dataset.
 * __DL-Model.py__ consists of an autoencoder and CNN training
 * __FLIM-generation.py__ for artificial data generation
 * __FLIMview-fitting__ is for fitting experimental data
